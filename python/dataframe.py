# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out country column as Pandas Series
print(cars['country'])

# Print out country column as Pandas DataFrame
print(cars[['country']])

# Print out DataFrame with country and drives_right columns
print(cars[['country', 'drives_right']])


### Select only row

# Print out first 3 observations
print(cars[0:3])

## Row only

# Print out observation for Japan
print(cars.loc['JPN'])
print(cars.iloc[2])

# Print out observations for Australia and Egypt
print(cars.loc[['AUS', 'EG']])
print(cars.iloc[[1, 6]])



# ROW and COLUMN

# Print out drives_right value of Morocco
print(cars.loc[['MOR'], ['drives_right']])

# Print sub-DataFrame
print(cars.loc[['RU', 'MOR'], ['country', 'drives_right']])

## Use with slice

# Print out drives_right column as Series
print(cars.loc[:, 'drives_right'])
print(cars.iloc[:, 2])

# Print out drives_right column as DataFrame
print(cars.iloc[:, [2]])

# Print out cars_per_cap and drives_right as DataFrame
print(cars.loc[:, ['cars_per_cap', 'drives_right']])



### filter data
# step
# 1. get column to series.
# 2. do a condition expresstion like >, <, logical_and, logical_or.
# 3. subset df, apply that expresstion to dataframe to get only data that meet condition.
# Example
# cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
# between = np.logical_and(cpc > 10, cpc < 80)
# medium = cars[between]

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Create car_maniac: observations that have a cars_per_cap over 500
car_maniac = cars[cars['cars_per_cap'] > 500]

# Create medium: observations with cars_per_cap between 100 and 500
medium = cars[np.logical_and(cars['cars_per_cap'] > 100, cars['cars_per_cap'] < 500)]

# Print car_maniac
print(car_maniac)
